ECMAScript: Raw JavaScript
ECMAScript is a language specification. It is basically the blueprint of how JavaScript should work.

Transpiled Languages (JavaScript Lookalikes)
Transpiled languages like CoffeeScript and TypeScript look similar to JavaScript, but arenâ€™t actually JavaScript. 
Others, like Emscripten, convert entirely different languages into JavaScript.

Babel is a popular transpiler that converts JavaScript to JavaScript. (mainly for converting newer JavaScript to older versions)
