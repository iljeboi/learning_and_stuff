Babel now supporting async/await out of the box, and ES2016 (or ES7) just around the corner, async & await 
basically just syntactic sugar on top of Promises, these two keywords alone should make writing asynchronous 
code in Node much more bearable.

ES5 -> Callback
ES6 -> Promise
ES7 -> async & await

async function getUserDetail() {
    try {
        let users = await getUsers();
        return users[0].name;
    } catch (err) {
        return {
            name: 'default user'
        };
    }
}

Good, async/await is a great syntactic improvement for both nodejs and browser programmers. 
Comparing to Promises, it is a shortcut to reach the same destination.
