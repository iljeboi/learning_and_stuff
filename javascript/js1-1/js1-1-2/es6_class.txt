JavaScript(ES6) Class

JavaScript classes, introduced in ES6, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScriptâ€™s existing 
prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance 
model to JavaScript. In early ES5 using function expression.


existing Prototype based inheritance:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
function Bike(model,color) {
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
}
 
Bike.prototype.getInfo = function() {
    return this.color + ' ' + this.model+ ' bike';
};
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ES6 class:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
class Bike{
  constructor(color, model) {
    this.color= color;
    this.model= model;
  }
}
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Benefits of Using class
- Convenient, self-contained syntax.
- A single, canonical way to emulate classes in JavaScript. Prior to ES6, there were several competing implementations in popular libraries.
- More familiar to people from a class-based language background.
