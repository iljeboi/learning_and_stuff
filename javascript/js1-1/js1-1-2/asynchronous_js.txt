<script src='index.js'>           //default Synchronous
<script async src='index.js'>      //parse as Asynchronously
<script defer src='index.js'>      //parse as deferred

If synchronous <script > tag occurs, JS engine will download the code and execute that code and after that only parsing the below HTML code, generally Synchronous is a blocking script execution.
If Asynchronous <script async> tag occurs, while downloading the code JS engine will parse the HTML and once If JS code gets downloaded pause the parsing and back into the JS Code Execution, generally Asynchronous is a Non-blocking script execution.
If Asynchronous <script defer> tag occurs, JS Engine will parse the all HTML code and after that only executes the JS Code.
