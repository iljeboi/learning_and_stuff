Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope 
before code execution.

console.log(Hoist);
var Hoist = ’The variable Has been hoisted’;
//output : undefined//

actually, JavaScript has hoisted the variable declaration. This is what the code above looks like to the interpreter

var Hoist;
console.log(Hoist);
Hoist = ’The variable Has been hoisted’;
