Events

Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:

- Things that should be done every time a page loads
- Things that should be done when the page is closed
- Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
- Content that should be verified when a user inputs data

Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

- HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
- HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
- You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
- You can prevent events from being sent or being handled

Platform Independence

- JavaScript is Platform Independent, which means you need to write the script once and can run it on any platform or browser without affecting the output of the Script.

Difference between a Scripting Language and a Programming Language

- Scripting language is a programming language supporting scripts written exclusively for a special runtime environment to automate a specific action/function execution.	
- Programming language is a set of instructions that can be fed into a computer to achieve a specific output.

- Scripting languages run inside another program.	
- Programming languages run independently of a parent program

- Scripting languages are made to make coding easier and faster.	
- Programming languages are made to make full-fledged code and software development easier.

- Scripting languages, on the other hand, demand line-by-line conversion.	
- Programming languages use a compiler, it is a one-shot conversion. 

- Python, JavaScript, Rexx, Ruby, GameMonkey, etc., are some of the most widely used scripting languages.	
- C, C++, C#, Java, Basic, COBOL, and Pascal, are some programming languages.
