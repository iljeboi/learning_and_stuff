Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that 
runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. 
It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and 
runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
